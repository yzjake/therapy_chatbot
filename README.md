# therapy_chatbot
## Introduction
As a group of four, we planned to create a theoretical chatbot focused on mental distress. We think this can be an interesting and meaningful project because mental distress is quite a common struggle among a decent amount of people but not everyone has the time or the chance to talk to someone or a therapist at a very early stage. Therefore, we think of training a chatbot with therapy conversation datasets to gain the ability for simple conversation interactions with the user. 

It's a relatively a cool topic for us but it is quite challenging to develop, so we embedded knowledge with multiple resources on how should we taggle and approach the development of our chatbot and we combined some of our knowledge and open resources online together to deliver our project deliverables.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvis23/mental-health-conversational-data

We picked the 28 most related tags(greeting, thanks, no-response, help, sad, stressed, worthless, depressed, happy, anxious, not-talking, sleep, scared, death, understand, done, suicide, default, wrong, ask, user-advice, meditation, learn-mental-health, Angry, User-agree, learn-more, no-approach) out of the original dataset and build on them to balance it with 25 pairs of patterns and responses under each tag.
